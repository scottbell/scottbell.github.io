## Experience

### Staff Software Engineer @ Sonar | September 2025 - Present
Backend Java Engineer focused on integrations.

### Staff Software Engineer @ TRACLabs (Individual Contributor) | August 2021 - September 2025
- **NASA Open MCT:** Core contributor to NASA's next-generation mission control framework for the VIPER Lunar Rover.
- **BioSim Modernization:** Led the migration of a legacy life support simulation to Java 21, introducing REST/WebSocket APIs and Docker for modern deployment and integration.
- **ADAPT AI System:** Developed a novel AI-powered decision support system with a Vue.js frontend and a Python/Quart backend, utilizing XGBoost and SHAP for explainable AI.
- **PRL Translator:** Created an LLM-based application to automatically convert natural language documents into structured PRL (Procedure Representation Language) XML, reducing procedure author time from hours to minutes.
- **ROS 2 Contributions:** Resolved critical type-handling bugs in the ROS 2 ecosystem (rosbridge_suite, roslibjs), improving reliability for the wider robotics community.

### Senior Software Engineer (Technical Lead) @ TRACLabs | August 2013 - 2021
Led the development of PRIDE, a software suite for automating standard operating procedures, used 24/7 by Fortune 500 companies (e.g., Dow, Baker Hughes), commercial space operators (Sierra Space), and NASA.
- **Tech Stack:** Node.js, MySQL, Vue.js, hosted on AWS & Azure.
- **Leadership:** Managed and mentored a team of over 12 frontend and backend developers, driving project execution through code reviews, technical guidance, and agile practices.
- **Product Strategy:** Prototyped new features, estimated schedules and costs, and planned releases, directly influencing the product roadmap.
- **Critical Impact:** Resolved critical system issues and coordinated with QA, DevOps, and product teams to ensure high availability for thousands of simultaneous users.
- **NASA Missions:** PRIDE was utilized by NASA for critical operations, including ISS spacewalks and the X-57 electric aircraft project.

### Software Engineer @ TRACLabs | August 2010 - 2013
Led development on integration between NASA's electronic procedure toolkit and NASA's Mission Control Technologies (MCT) software, both Java-based. The goal was to modernize NASA's Mission Control display software for telemetry, procedures, and commanding.

Also led development of PRONTOE, an ontology editor for domain experts. The Java-based tool allowed complex ontology development by non-computer scientists and was used for training astronaut candidates at NASA.

### Software Engineer @ S&K Aerospace and NASA Johnson Space Center | August 2002 - 2006
Lead developer on BioSim, a discrete event life support simulation for intelligent control algorithms. The simulation was a test bed for studies ranging from machine learning to reliability theory, used by research institutions including MIT, Rice, Vanderbilt, UIUC, UC, and the NSF.

### Earlier Positions | 1996 - 2002
**Computer Systems Specialist** @ Laboratory for Intelligent Processes and Systems  
**Research Assistant** @ Laboratory for Intelligent Processes and Systems  
**Internships** @ Amazon.com, Sun Microsystems, Applied Research Laboratories  
**Teaching Assistant** @ University of Texas at Austin
