 * Technologies: Node.js, AWS, REST, MySQL

## Experience
### Lead Software Engineer (August 2013 to Present) @ TRACLabs
I lead development on PRIDE, a software suite for automating standard operating procedures for both humans and robots. The software is in use 24/7 at Fortune 500 companies, commercial space operators, and at NASA, and has thousands of simultaneous users. The application stack is Node.js, MySQL, a Vue.js frontend, and hosted on AWS & Azure. NASA used PRIDE during several ISS spacewalks. 

I manage the technical work of over a dozen frontend and backend developers, which includes stand ups, code reviews, hiring, and providing technical guidance and coaching to developers and engineers. I also create prototypes for new features, estimate schedules and costs, plan feature sets and releases, and file for patents. I'm responsible for locating and directing resolutions for critical issues related to the software system, and coordinate with QA, DevOps, product management, and marketing.
 
### Senior Software Engineer (August 2006 to 2013) @ TRACLabs and NASA Johnson Space Center
I led development on an integration between NASA's electronic procedure toolkit and NASA's Mission Control Technologies (MCT) software, both Java-based. The goal of the project was to modernize NASA's Mission Control display software of telemetry, procedures, and commanding.

I also led development of PRONTOE, an ontology editor for domain experts. Created in concert with NASA, the Java based tool allowed for complex ontology development by non-computer scientists. PRONTOE was used for training astronaut candidates at NASA.

I also led development on a complex event processor for space system telemetry called DARE (Data Abstraction Runtime Engine). DARE was a Java based, high performance, and easily scaled system using ActiveMQ as its message bus. DARE was developed to help both humans, e.g., Mission Control, and robots reason on higher level state information instead of a cacophony of telemetry data.

### Software Engineer (August 2002 to 2006) @ S&K Aerospace and NASA Johnson Space Center
I was sole developer on a discrete event life support simulation for machine learning algorithms called BioSim. The simulation was a test bed for studies ranging from machine learning to reliability theory. The simulation is open source and still used today by many research institutions and universities including: MIT, Rice, Vanderbilt, The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, The University of California, and the National Science Foundation.

### Computer Systems Specialist (January 2002 to August 2002) @ Laboratory for Intelligent Processes and Systems
Developed and researched novel software engineering applications and techniques ranging from pandemic response, to multi-agent architectures.
	
### Research Assistant (November 1996 to January 2002) @ Laboratory for Intelligent Processes and Systems
Developed a software engineering research tool that connected software requirement to specific changes in code. The application used Java and CORBA, with a Swing frontend. 
	
### Internship (Summer 1999) @ Amazon.com
Wrote Java database extraction and testing tool for Oracle database. Assisted in porting enterprise applications from C++ to Java that connected warehouses to suppliers.
	
### Internship (Summer 1998) @ Sun Microsystems, Inc.
Wrote test engine for Java ME and assisted in development.
	
### Internship (Summer 1997) @ Applied Research Laboratories
Assisted in development of distributed version control software written in Java. Migrated backend database connection to Postgres.
	
### Teaching Assistant (September 1997 to May 1999) @ University of Texas at Austin
Helped students with symbolic representation and design patterns. Lectured on Java programming fundamentals.

## Patents
*System and method for executing operations specified in a procedure language* \
[Issued Jul 3, 2018 Patent issuer and number us 10013266](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/10013266)
> A system for executing a procedure includes a procedure execution engine. The procedure execution engine is configured to translate a procedure defined via a procedure language to natural language statements corresponding to the operations specified by the procedure language. The procedure execution engine is also configured to generate a user interface for controlling execution of the procedure, and to display the natural language statements via the user interface. The procedure execution engine is further configured to indicate progress of execution of the procedure, via the user interface, based on the displayed natural language statements.

## Education
2001 B.S. Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin
